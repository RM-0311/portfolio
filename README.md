Hello all,

This repo will serve as my portfolio and Resume for Web3.

I am a student at Pittsburg State University, majoring in Mathematics with a Minor in Computing. In addition to my time there, I have been spending my personal time for the past year studying blockchain, its benefits and uses, as well as the future it may hold for us. For the past few months, I have begun the transition from a researcher to a builder, and have learned basic front-end development, but spent the most time on Solidity and Smart Contract development.

I am currently working on projects with multiple DAOs, as well as learning more in-depth Solidity skills and React. Updated projects will be added here as they are completed, but many have not been listed due to me only wanting to mention projects that I made a significant difference in. I look forward to working on the future of the internet with all of you.
