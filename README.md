GM frens,

This repo will serve as my portfolio and Resume for Web3. I am currently working on projects with multiple DAOs, as well as learning more in-depth Solidity skills and React. Updated projects will be added here as they are completed, but many have not been listed due to me only wanting to mention projects that I made a significant difference in. I look forward to working on the future of the internet with all of you.
